There can be minor errors because some functions have been changed a little (i.e. using arrays instead of numpy vectors with dimensions)

Optional/Advanced exercises (i.e. CNNs backpropagations) are mostly skipped.

Some of these might not be accepted/passed by grader (i.e. ResNet-50 in CNNs). The reason is that the results can be different. Try seeing posts on the Weekly Discussion forum or try tweaaking your model.
